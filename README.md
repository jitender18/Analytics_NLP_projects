Texas Senate Election Race:-

Objective:- To find the factors which play a huge role and affect the outcome of an election poll.

Steps:-
1. Scrapped the Tweets from Twitter for both the candidates using multiple hashtags
2. Data Cleaning as the data from twitter is mostly messy containing emojis, special characters and short form of many words
3. Summarized the data for both the candidates and allocated into different main topics
4. Performed sentiment analysis on each topic to find people's opinion about candidates on several topics
5. Finally combined all the scores and calculated overall sentiment
6. Used basic statistical techniques to find which candidate has an upper hand in winning the elections poll

NOTE: - Twitter sentiment analysis can give you a good insight of candidates' standings in the state, but do keep in mind that not many people are on twitter and also your samples are somewhat biased. It will be a better idea to do analysis across multiple social media platforms to comeup with a strong evidence for your prediction.
